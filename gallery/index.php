This particular hospital had previously used Zolatone’s Polomyx finish, and after 10 years (can you believe that?!) they were looking to update their hallways. They loved Polomyx, but didn’t want to shut down the wing of the hospital this time around to spray apply a finish and found Flex to be the perfect (rollable) solution. Hiding the scuffs and stains and holding up to cleaning chemicals, all while allowing the hospital to remain open, was a big win for them.</p>
