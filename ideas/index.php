They were looking for a finish that was environmentally friendly, efficient, crisp yet soft, clean and durable, but with a 'pop' to draw your eyes to this architectural feature, and that's exactly what they got. The designer chose our Counterpointe finish PFX-10216 to achieve this and it resulted in a very welcoming environment!</p>
