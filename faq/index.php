                <h4 class="color-primary border-primary-top small-margin-top-3">Why should I use Zolatone instead of regular paints?</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-0">With Zolatone paints you’ll get more dimension, texture and patina than you would with a regular paint. But that’s not all, you’ll also get a longer lasting and more durable finish that holds up to the wear and tear of everyday use and traffic.</p>

                <h4 class="color-primary border-primary-top small-margin-top-3">How quickly can you send us samples?</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-0">Stock samples are available the next day, and custom color matches take three to five business days.</p>

                <h4 class="color-primary border-primary-top small-margin-top-3">Are all the finishes spray applied? Do you need special training? Is it complicated?</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-0">No, Zolatone requires no special training to apply. Lluminations, Metal and Polomyx are all spray applied with conventional equipment. Counterpointe and Polomyx Airless are both applied with airless spray equipment. Flex, our newest finish, is roller applied. We have application videos online and application instructions ship with every order. If anyone needs special help, our technical experts are just a phone call away.</p>

                <h4 class="color-primary border-primary-top small-margin-top-3">Our Painters tell us it can’t be touched up, can it?</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-0">Yes, it can! There are various ways to touch up our finishes. Check out our videos and resources to learn more about which way is right for you, or, call our customer service team.</p>

                <h4 class="color-primary border-primary-top small-margin-top-3">What colors are available for each finish?</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-0">There are an unlimited amount of colors available for our finishes. Our Light Vision additive works best in light finishes.</p>
